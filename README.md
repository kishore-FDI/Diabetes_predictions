# Diabetes Prediction Model

This Jupyter Notebook project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning. The implemented model employs various algorithms to analyze health indicators and make predictions regarding the likelihood of diabetes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them by running the following command in a Jupyter Notebook cell:

```python
!pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

### Running the Code

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook (`diabetes_prediction.ipynb`).
2. Open the notebook in your Jupyter environment.
3. Execute the code cells to train and evaluate the diabetes prediction model.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The model is trained on a dataset containing health indicators, including glucose levels, BMI, and blood pressure. Explore performance metrics like accuracy and precision, visualized for better understanding.

## Results

Gain insights into the predictive capabilities of the model through visualizations and performance metrics. Experiment with hyperparameters or try different algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion

This Jupyter Notebook project serves as a foundation for predicting diabetes based on health indicators. Use the model as a starting point for healthcare applications or as a reference for understanding machine learning in medical diagnosis.
